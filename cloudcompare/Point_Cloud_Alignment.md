# Input Point Clouds

At both the WGEW and SRER sites the Riegl terrestrial laser scanner 
was set up using reflective targets placed atop ground control 
rebar pins whose locations were established from either TotalStation 
survey or RTK-GPS.

In Kendall Grassland and Lucky Hill Shrubland reflective laser targets 
were placed on five rebar stakes whose locations were established 
from USGS benchmarks and back azimuth measured from a TotalStation.

At the SRER woodland site ground control pins were placed throughout
the survey area (13 rebar stakes) and located using RTK-GPS.

The terrestrial sfm from the Sony a6000 and DJI Osmo did not use GPS. 
Their locations were referenced from the GCPs visible in the processed 
clouds or features referenced in other point clouds (TLS, sUAS), 
typically only one to two GCPs were visible per terrestrial sfm cloud.

### Terrestrial laser scanning
The TLS models were georeferenced in [Riegl RiScan software](http://www.riegl.com/products/software-packages/)

### GPS and IMU integrations

Lidar from moving platofmrs requires an integrated GNSS/IMU (Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Motion Unit). GNSS(GPS) and IMU provide the position, rotation, and motion of the scanning platform. Depending on the system used there are variable quantities of uncertainty (error) associated with the measurement location. 

The sUAS use small relatively cheap GNSS units, such as the [ublox](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/neo-m8-series) and standard [DJI](https://www.dji.com/phantom-4/info)

### Reprojection

I reprojected all of the point clouds to WGS84 Web Mercator (EPSG: 3857)

SRER PAG 2011

```
docker run -v ${PWD}:/data pdal/pdal:1.5 pdal translate \
/data/pag11/srer_mad.las /data/pag11/srer_mad_wgs84.las reprojection \
--filters.reprojection.out_srs="EPSG:4326" \
--writers.las.scale_x=0.0000001 \
--writers.las.scale_y=0.0000001 \
--writers.las.offset_x="auto" \
--writers.las.offset_y="auto"
```

WGEW 2015

### Outlier Removal

I created PDAL pipelines to remove vertical outliers and to establish height above ground (hag) for each of the point clouds.

PDAL uses .json files for executing pipelines.

# Alignment of point clouds

Point clouds projected in different datums and geoids can have significant misalignment when they are loaded together.

## Alignment in CloudCompare

I used the finely align two point cloud tool and "3-point picking" to align 
the test point clouds to the reference TLS scans from the Reigl.

The Reigl lidar used targets placed on dGPS pins at SRER. At WGEW the Reigl 
used targets placed on dGPS and TotalStation surveyed pins. 

In the case of the DJI Phantom 4 black and white targets were placed on the dGPS pins.

### Display in Entwine/Potree/Greyhound

After finishing the analyses I used Entwine to create web browser viewable data.

```
docker run -it -v ${PWD}:/data connormanning/entwine build -i /data/plot4_all_nadir_shutter_correction.las -o ~/entwine/plot4_all_nadir
```

```
docker run -it -v ~/entwine:/entwine -p 8080:8080 connormanning/greyhound
```
