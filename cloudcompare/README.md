# CloudCompare

CloudCompare can work with [numerous point cloud formats](http://www.cloudcompare.org/doc/wiki/index.php?title=FILE_I/O) making it ideal for comparing data collected from SfM and lidar.

CloudCompare uses parallel tasks for many of its operations, e.g. M3C2. Jetstream's XXL instance with 44 cores was particularly powerful for working with very large point clouds.

## Setting up CloudCompare for the first time

On my Linux (Ubuntu 16.04) workstation I installed [CloudCompare](http://www.cloudcompare.org/) using `snapd`

To use the `install_cloudcompare.sh` file associated with this folder, copy the file to a local directory, change the permissions on the file, and run:

```
chmod +x install_cloudcompare.sh

./install_cloudcompare.sh

```

You can also install CloudCompare on Windows or Mac OS X using those [OS installation packages](http://www.cloudcompare.org/release/index.html).

### Install [Snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install)

```
$ sudo apt install snapd
```

### Snap install CloudCompare for Ubuntu

```
$ snap install cloudcompare
```

There is a bug in the current LTR version of CC (v2.8.1) so we moved to use the `edge` version 2.9

```
$ sudo snap refresh cloudcompare --edge
```

In order to access external volumes with the snap install of CloudCompare:

```
sudo snap connect  cloudcompare:removable-media  :removable-media
```

## Commandline  

CloudCompare can also be used from the [command line](http://www.cloudcompare.org/doc/wiki/index.php?title=Command_line_mode)

## CloudCompare on Atmosphere

Copy the CloudCompare Github repo to the virtual machine instance

```
git clone https://github.com/CloudCompare/CloudCompare.git
```

Run the Snap deploy script

```
sudo ./scripts/linux/snap_deploy.sh $(pwd)
```

Install CloudCompare using `snap`

We are running the `--devmode` because of an issue with an unsigned signature

```
sudo snap install --devmode cloudcompare_2.9.0-beta_amd64.snap
```

Need to determine how to bulid `Liblas` on linux to use `.laz` files
