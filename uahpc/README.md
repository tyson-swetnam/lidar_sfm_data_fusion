# University of Arizona HPC systems

You must have a valid UA NetID and have registered for an HPC account with [UA Services](https://account.arizona.edu/welcome)

# Auth

Open a terminal window and `ssh`

```
ssh uid@hpc.arizona.edu
```
To use an interactive window you need to use the `-X` or `-Y` command

```
ssh -X uidm@hpc.arizona.edu
```
## Starting jobs on UA HPC El Gato

El Gato uses `LSF` for its job submissions

Attached are several `bsub` scripts for running jobs on El Gato

## Starting jobs on UA HPC Ocelote

Ocelote uses PBS to manage jobs. [UA HPC Manual wiki](https://confluence.arizona.edu/display/UAHPC/Training)

### Setting up UA HPC w/o using password and DUO security

If you haven't done so, create an .ssh key, [generic instructions here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/ssh-essentials-working-with-ssh-servers-clients-and-keys)

```
ssh-keygen
```

After you've created the key you can use your pub key `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to go ahead and ssh into the UA HPC

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh uid@hpc.arizona.edu "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

You will have to enter your password and DUO security one last time. You will see that you're not logged into the HPC after this process completes.

Now go ahead and log back in using your user id name

```
ssh uid@hpc.arizona.edu
```

### [Photoscan]()

First you need to download a copy of the latest photoscan onto your `home/user` or shared directory

```
wget http://download.agisoft.com/photoscan-pro_1_3_1_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvzf photoscan-pro_1_3_1_amd64.tar.gz
rm photoscan-pro_1_3_1_amd64.tar.gz
```

Start Photoscan as server

```
bsub photoscan_master.sh
```

Start Photoscan worker nodes

```
photoscan_node.sh
```
