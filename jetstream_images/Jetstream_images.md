# Jetstream Images

I created a couple of custom images on Jetstream and Atmospphere for running my analyses.

My first image is the Jetstream [base Ubuntu 14.04 development XCFE GUI image with iRODS](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/images/54)
to which I've added Docker CE and Docker-Compose

[Ubuntu dev w/ Docker and Docker-Compose](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/images/359)
minimum size: small 2-core, 4GB RAM.

The second image is the same base with [Ubuntu 14.04 with GDAL 2.1 and GRASS 7.2](https://use.jetstream-cloud.org/application/images/330) 
built from source, minimum size: small 2-core, 4GB RAM.

# Install scripts

In this folder are several installation scripts for building these images
