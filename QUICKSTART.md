# Quick Start instructions


## Goal

<!---
Avoid covering upstream and downstream steps that are not explicitly and necessarily part of the tutorial - write or link to separate quick starts/tutorials for those parts
--->

<!---
A few sentences (50 words or less) describing the ultimate goal of the steps in this tutorial
--->

The goal of this tutorial is to get you up and running with the same VM images, softare, and Docker containers as the analyses used in the text.
